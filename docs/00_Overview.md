# StorageUnit_SimLay — Overview

## Problem

Storage-unit buyers, resellers, and facility operators often deal with large volumes of mixed, unorganized items. Typical pain points include:

- Hundreds of photos with no structure
- Difficulty identifying what is actually inside a unit
- No fast way to estimate resale value
- Time wasted manually creating spreadsheets
- Difficulty collaborating with partners remotely
- High uncertainty in deal evaluation

SimLay exists to reduce friction, bring structure to chaos, and improve decision-making speed.

## Vision

SimLay is an intelligent assistant that transforms raw storage-unit photos into a structured, searchable inventory — complete with categories, estimated value ranges, and exportable reports. The experience should feel simple, fast, and supportive rather than technical or overwhelming.

Think:  
**Upload → Review → Decide → Profit.**

The goal is not perfection — it is speed, clarity, and leverage.
